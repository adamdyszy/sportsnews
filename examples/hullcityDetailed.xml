We changed the shape, pressed a bit higher and once we did that, we looked a really good, organised, structured team.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p class=&quot;x_MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Tetteh&amp;rsquo;s ferocious left-footed strike was the Ghanaian&amp;rsquo;s first goal for the Tigers and Rosenior enthused: &amp;ldquo;It was a cracker! A left footer in the far stanch.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p class=&quot;x_MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&amp;ldquo;He&amp;rsquo;s capable of it. He&amp;rsquo;s done it in training so for him to bring it out on the big stage, I&amp;rsquo;m delighted with him and he kept working for the team.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p class=&quot;x_MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&amp;ldquo;I took him on 65 minutes because he got a stamp on his foot &amp;ndash; hopefully, it&amp;rsquo;s not too bad.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p class=&quot;x_MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The forward was visibly emotional after opening his City account, with the boss explaining: &amp;ldquo;He&amp;rsquo;s had an emotional few weeks. A lot of the players have been affected by the awful disaster&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;T&amp;uuml;rkiye.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p class=&quot;x_MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&amp;ldquo;One of Benji&amp;rsquo;s best friends was Christian Atsu (who tragically passed away in the earthquake) and he&amp;rsquo;s been down so I&amp;rsquo;m sure he&amp;rsquo;ll dedicate that goal to him.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/Nwbr1p2zKcU&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</BodyText><GalleryImageURLs></GalleryImageURLs><VideoURL></VideoURL><OptaMatchId>g2300132</OptaMatchId><LastUpdateDate>2023-03-04 10:27:02</LastUpdateDate><IsPublished>True</IsPublished></NewsArticle></NewsArticleInformation>
