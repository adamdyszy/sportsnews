I thought I was good, I thought I was strong but Neil has managed to break those limits that I\u0026rsquo;d previously set for myself. We had one more lap to go round and I went up to him to say that I have nothing left and I can\u0026rsquo;t do it. He just kept telling me that I can do this final lap.

Based on the information published to date by other clubs, Brentford\u0026rsquo;s pricing for individual match tickets remains amongst the lowest in the league.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNevertheless, the strong concerns raised by BIAS against the recent \u0026pound;5 price increase across different categories were acknowledged. Their recent statement, stating their opposition to any matchday price increases, was reiterated and noted. Bees United understood there were rising costs across the Club and wider economy but felt that family groups could have been protected against rising ticket prices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn light of the discussions at the meeting, the Club has taken another look at the proposed pricing structure for next season, particularly for families coming to games. As a result, the Club has decided not to increase the Match Ticket price for Junior tickets (0-17 years) for the 2022/23 season. The pricing structure for other age categories remains unchanged. \u0026pound;5 credits will be made in the coming days in relation to any Junior tickets already purchased for the Manchester United match next month.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eData in relation to ticket sales for Category B away matches last season was also presented at the meeting. The benefits of a more streamlined system were explained by the Club. Reassurances were also provided that the decisions have been based on the actual demand and sales for tickets to the respective games last season. The Club stated that they have confidence that the changes will not prevent Season Ticket Holders from gaining access to Category B away Match Tickets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBees United said that they understood the rationale behind the changes but wanted a firm commitment to an immediate review of how the system worked for the first game in which it will be applied \u0026ndash; the Leicester City match. BIAS outlined that their main concern is in relation to the perceived loss felt by those Season Ticket Holders within the highest TAP bracket who feel that they should continue to be first in line for Category B away matches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince the meeting, the first sales window for tickets for the Leicester City away match has taken place. An allocation of around 3,100 tickets was made available to all Season Ticket Holders on Friday at 2pm. By 5pm on Friday, 1,900 tickets had been sold; by 8.30pm on Friday, 1,997 tickets had been sold and by 9am on Tuesday, 2,207 tickets had been sold. This means that we have 29 per cent of the available allocation left which will now go to Members in the second sales window for this match, opening at 2pm today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce the sales for the Leicester City match are complete, we will conduct a review with BIAS and Bees United to consider whether any changes to the Category B ticketing policy are required.\u0026nbsp; Regardless of the outcome of those discussions, the Club will continue to review the sales process on an ongoing basis through the season.\u003c/p\u003e","url":"https://www.brentfordfc.com/news/2022/july/club-meets-fan-groups-to-discuss-pricing-and-sales-processes-for-away-matches/","imageUrl":"https://www.brentfordfc.com/api/image/feedassets/efa94fcb-3a8b-446f-87f0-1881dade0d06/Medium/club-statement---tickets-.jpg","galleryUrls":null,"videoUrl":null,"published":"2022-07-19T09:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"be8022ec-f810-5e41-8509-faa3e7277264","teamId":"t94","optaMatchId":null,"title":"Peter Gilham's Blog: Brentford in Germany, Day Seven","type":["First Team"],"teaser":null,"content":"\u003ch5\u003eWe're only a day away from the end of the pre-season training camp in Southern Germany.

The locality, the hotel and all the facilities it offers and provides, the local football club, SV Aasen - who have played host to our training sessions and also host our friendly against RC Strasbourg Alsace - and of course the incredible weather have made it very memorable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday was again a scorcher albeit a degree or so below what many back home have been suffering.

Whilst it was thought there may be a different challenge for those who haven\u0026rsquo;t sung since last July (at the St George\u0026rsquo;s Park pre-season camp), the general consensus from the players was that they themselves had had to endure it so why should others get away with it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, a quick report on the staff \u0026ldquo;mad dogs of Englishmen\u0026rdquo; Beach Volleyball Match.

Then it was Zanka\u0026rsquo;s chance to impress with a number entitled \u0026ldquo;Burn\u0026rdquo; which I believe was co-written and sung by R\u0026amp;B singer Usher. Another thank you, this time to one of the Media team Chris Deacon, for helping me identify each song. Again, a number of the players joined in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, it was Wissa\u0026rsquo;s turn and he surprisingly turned down the opportunity of performing along to \u0026ldquo;Free from Desire\u0026rdquo;. Instead, he chose \u0026ldquo;Ramanez la coupe a la maison\u0026rdquo; by Vegedream.

We've now played game two and as we head to Wales next week we will have another match at the end of the week against Swansea so we're in a good place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the United goal coming from a set play, Neil said the side will continue to work on the training ground and as personnel settle into the group in the coming weeks, that will help the team get into a rhythm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe explained: \"You have to deal with the physical threat and it was summed up in the first half where we had total domination of the game but we succumbed to a wide free-kick in what was the only goal of the game. That's what these games can do to you, they either hit you with that direct style of play or on set plays. Again, that's things we can keep brushing up on through pre-season, but it's very much a changed group and we have a number of Trialists in which will settle down in the weeks to come.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe match also presented the chance for new signing Yehor Yarmoliuk to get his first run out in red and white as he played the final 30 minutes of the match and showed some impressive glimpses as he adjusted to his new team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We're delighted for him, he's been in with us now for three days and we've been helping him to settle in at the Club,\" said Neil. \"On the training ground his attitude has been first class and you can see glimpses of what he will bring to us. For him, like the rest of the group, it's about gradually building on those fitness levels.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe B Team will head to South Wales for a training camp on Monday next week as they continue their pre-season work and with the squad continuing to develop in recent weeks with some new additions, Neil feels it will be a good opportunity to bring the group together for an extended time, leaving opportunities for more hard to work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said: \"As always when we go on tours, particularly at this stage of pre-season, it's great to bring the staff and players together. We will have more time than ever to work with them on and off the pitch. We'll then start slowly to work on more things (on the training pitch) and it will then culminate in a really good game against Swansea.\"\u003c/p\u003e","url":"https://www.brentfordfc.com/news/2022/july/maidenhead-reaction-neil-macfarlane/","imageUrl":"https://www.brentfordfc.com/api/image/feedassets/d80736e5-b547-4b83-92ff-9dd6b9b32a5e/Medium/maidenhead_united_brentford_b_tgs028.jpg","galleryUrls":null,"videoUrl":null,"published":"2022-07-17T11:00:00.000Z"}],"metadata":{"createdAt":"2023-03-06T09:08:57.789Z","totalItems":20,"sort":"-published"}}
